-- Note: originally declared 'yarn' and 'webpack' as dependencies here (build
-- tooling markers from the upstream cfx-server-data source, not real FiveM
-- resources). FXServer's resource scanner was treating them as literal
-- missing resource dependencies and refusing to start this resource at all.
-- The dist/ folder below is now pre-built and committed directly, so no
-- build step or dependency on those is needed at runtime.
